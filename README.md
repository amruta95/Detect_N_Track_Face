# Face Detection and Tracking
Implemented a Computer Vision model to detect face in the first frame of a video using pre-trained Viola Jones Detector and to continue tracking it in the rest of the video using:
- CAMShift
- Particle Filter
- Kalman Filter.

This is implemented in OpenCV 3.3.0 and Python 2.7
